                            We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all payment pages where personal information is required.

                            You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser like Safari.
